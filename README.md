# Sprixle
Sprixle is a rendering agnostic game engine written in TypeScript. It has currently been developed for mostly personal use and as such does not have super strong documentation yet.

It is centered around a simple ECS implementation and as I learn techniques gets easier and easier to work with.

# Usage
Currently Sprixle is intended as a git sub-repo within your code's root (`src/`) you can copy-paste boilerplate and webpack files to the root to get started fairly quickly.

# Games / Examples
the [boilerplate](boilerplate) folder serves as an example currently and will be reworked into pure boilerplate as I split out actual examples.

for Ludum Dare I developed both of these games:
* [Eucalyptus](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/eucalyptus)
* [Somebody Will Die](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/52/somebody-will-die)

More recently I developed a multiplayer party game that pits teams of 2 in a "movie style hacker" race to hack the mainframe first which debuted at a party in LA and Reggie Watts posted the only [video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CvBs3KSr5l0/) I currently have access to  lol, I'll update more on this front as it releases to the public.
